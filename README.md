 project discriptions.
 we are tasked to build simple calculator using javascript HTML and CSS which will allow user to insert assignment by enterring assignment name and and grade and it will dynamically calculate and display GPA. 
All entered assignments are shown on the page, and pressing the "S" key logs the current data to the browser console. Optionally, the project uses localStorage to save entries so that data persists even after refreshing the page.
we are tasked our selves to add an other option for clearing assingment so that we can create an other one incase needed or in case of any mistakes made by user while inpiting data.
